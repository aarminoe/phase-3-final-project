Welcome to Tasker!

This is a To-do application that will allow a User to track their current Goals, Reminders, etc.

Users will be met at the log in screen where they will be able to either log in with their Username and Password. Alternatively, they can create a new account by clicking the 'Create Profile' button. This will show a few input bars at the bottom of the page where a user will be able to input their desired username, password, and bio. Once finished click 'Create Profile!' and log in.



##Making New Tasks##
Upon logging in a user will see an empty board. This is where you can create new tasks to do. Clicking on 'New Task' will allow a user to input a Task name, category, and Due date. Click 'Add Task' and your personalized task will show up on your Task Board.

Each Task gives you access to edit the name, category, and due date. You can also click the checkmark button when you have completed the task, deleting it off of your task board. Clicking on the 'Updates' button will allow a user to add updates to that particular Task. For example if the task was a Doctor's appointment, a user could add an update that they had to reschedule the appointment or perhaps add the Doctors Office phone number. Each update will also be accompanied by and 'x' button that will allow a user to delete that update.

The left side of the page shows 'Tasks', which is your task board. Under that it will show your username where a user will be able to see their username and bio. Under that is 'Taskers'. This will show all the users on the application. Clicking on their name will allow you to see their specific bio. Finally, under all of those pages is a log out button where a user will be able to log out of their account when they are done updating their taskboard.

Happy Tasking
